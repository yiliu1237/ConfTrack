# ConfTrack

Stay in sync with major academic deadlines.

## Overview

ConfTrack is a lightweight reminder tool built to help academic researchers and students stay ahead of major conference deadlines like CVPR, SIGGRAPH, ECCV, ICCV, and more.  
Instead of manually tracking dates, ConfTrack connects you with an **IFTTT** (If This Then That) applet to deliver automated monthly email reminders - so you can focus on your research, not your calendar.

> ConfTrack uses [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore), a free automation platform, to handle reminders.

## How It Works
1. Open the ConfTrack webpage.
2. Read about the reminder system and its purpose.
3. Click the **Launch the Reminder App** button.
4. Connect with **IFTTT** and enable the ConfTrack applet.
5. Receive an email on the 1st of each month reminding you to check upcoming conference deadlines.

ConfTrack does not store your data - it simply redirects you to IFTTT for managing reminders.
